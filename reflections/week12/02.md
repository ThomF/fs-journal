# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

- SO far so good on backend. I have about 50% done with it and I am feeling good. Worried about front end but hoping that all of this stuff on backend will aid well.
- After a day of work I am pretty set into the front end and I am getting it done quick. Backend is very much helping everything go smooth.
-First grade good 14/18 and I need some small things edited and moved around for the mock reqs and codework standards.
