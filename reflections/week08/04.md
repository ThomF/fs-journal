## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
    -Unit, integration, end to end. unit is separating code into sections. Integration is everything is tested as one. and end to end is the test as if you go through the application as a user.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
    -   I would say end to end as it tests everything for what vue does on the client side and can show problems with every UI and code error. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
-   Unit might take too long to utilize compared to other tests.
