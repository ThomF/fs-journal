## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
    - This provides a window for developers to show off their work in a unique way as the portfolio is made specifically by the developer for the work to be displayed. 

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
    -these portfolios need to show off the work I make and not be visually over the top. Easy user experience while having some special touches added.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
    -I would want to include the network and the tower as it is a great representation of my VueJS learning. I would also say my clicker game because it visually looks good and its just a fun simple game. As well I would want to have my capstone in the portfolio as it is unique to my group.
