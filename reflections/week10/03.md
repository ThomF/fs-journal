## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
-   Rows contain the entire singular objects info while a column is the specific set of data.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
-   CREATE TABLE  characters{
    id INT NOT NULL COMMENT 'ID',
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL COMMENT 'Name',
    age INT NOT NULL COMMENT 'Age,
    description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL COMMENT 'Description'
}

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
-   Delete is going to specifically grab whatever data you want and take it out of the table where the other option will exile the entire table from existence.
