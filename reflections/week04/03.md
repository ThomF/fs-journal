## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?
    -   This pretty much allows for slower functions to perform on time. example, getting from an api can take a few seconds and javascript is fast so It would break everything if there wasnt async and await. 

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?
    -   you have to use async so that the files know what kind of function is taking place. 

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
    -   One would be the ability to wait for API calls. Another is you can grantee the function will run before others so things work on time.
