> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
    - A big one that was shown was }) multiple times in a row. This is a huge sign that there are way too many callbacks that could end up all running at the same time and potentially breaking.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
    - Async is when you want code to run not all at once and to pretty much slow it down to prevent damage to the application. This prevents the callbacks issue from becoming a thing in larger functions. 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
    - Use Async, utilize modules in code that are shallow so they arent over packed, and handle errors as they are presented.
