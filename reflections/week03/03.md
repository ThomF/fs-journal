## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
    - the initial OBJ that gets and sets for the handler to use. 

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?
    - You have to return a value within it like a template so that it can be read right. You will also need backtick if using a template form.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
    - We can call an object without directly using it and this maybe could prevent it from being used or broken wrongly. Not entirely sure about this.
