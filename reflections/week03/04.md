> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
    - My understanding it watches for changes to something in the code, their example is a word count and I could see an observer watching for added words or removed words and updating something on the side as this is working. 

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
    - SUbscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
    - The BCW template is really good at running like an engine and it provides a very quick and easy way to push information quickly through multiple hoops into the DOM. It manages everything well and makes learning MVC a little nicer.
