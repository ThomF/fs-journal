## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
    - Encapsulation is great for slowing and even stopping major errors in code that runs from one file to many. Creating a system that runs more smoothly. 

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
    - Less use of the API, you hope that someone knows that it doesnt apply to them, and it also isnt as well known for all programmers according to the reading.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
    - Just above an export we are able to create variables that we want to keep out of the reach of most people so that our code isnt broken.
