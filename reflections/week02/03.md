## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
    - we can use innerHTML, console.log, document.write, and window.alert. innerHtml is good for manipulating the DOM and changing things on screen quickly. Console.log is good for finding error or checking functions. window.alert is good for throwing errors or changes in the site. Document.write is good for strings

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
    - inspect tab is good for quickly changing something without changing the main file system. 
3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
    - you can use the debugger to slowly move through code and find exactly where something breaks.
