# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This week was insane. I honestly struggled to grasp some concepts. Some being how to properly form a function. I doubted my thought process and it hurt me. I did in end learn to write a function but it was a huge struggle. one thing I consider a victory is that I was able to search fora  solution to an issue and work out how to implement it. I wasnt sure about an approach I had on the checkpoint and it was helpful to take a step back. Research it. And reading my notes. It all came together only after taking patient time.
