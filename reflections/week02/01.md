## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
    -Scope is the available area for a variable to be activated.
2. What is Hoisting ?
    -Hoisting is when you call a variable but leave the definition undefined till a lower point. It still is declared because of the var but the declaration was moved down.
3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
    -let is great for common declarations inside of functions or out. Const is good for declarations that dont need to be changed. Var you can call it twice with two different declarations but it isnt recommended.
