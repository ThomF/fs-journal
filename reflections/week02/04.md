## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
    - Planning well but not too much can allow for a more precise adjustment to the big picture as time goes on and not when everything breaks. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
    - I would go to my notes, if that didnt work then student handouts then I would search any forum I could because going slow while stuck is important so I wouldnt get confused. 

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
    - It was eye opening because I do half of these at least and the other half in my head without knowing. I find that it is great to see really strong programmers had the same issues as I am having now. One being planning code before tackling it and making it messy.
