## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
    - function declaration, function expression, arrow function. Function declaration is the normal way that functions are written. Function expression you can store a variable in the function as the functions description. Arrow functions shorthand code so a function can be smaller.

    - Parameters is defining the function and Arguments is the value of an invoked function.
3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
    - These functions take other functions as arguments similar to parameters. 
    - const exampleFunction = (ex) =>{
        return ex()
    }
