# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    -This week was an overall victory. I felt stressed half the time and overwhelmed but also I felt like I was learning quickly or at a great pace.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    -The biggest shock was how easy it is to design mock sites with bootstrap. I tried to build mock sites in the past with no knowledge of how bootstrap worked and it was a nightmare. With this skill set and knowledge I am excited to see what my front-end abilities can grow to become. 
- What are you struggling with?
    -There were a few struggles. Learning in general at first was a shock but did work well in the end of the week. I would say that remembering all the little tricks to keeping less padding tags in a class is my biggest struggle. I use them alot and really rely on using @media to get them to revert on mobile. There has to be a better way right?
- What would you count as a victory?
    -My ability to pick up on the topic of bootstrap so quickly. This was a huge victory and even though I am new at it still its a huge start.
