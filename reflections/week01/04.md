## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
 - Wire framing is able to be re-arranged easily, show the pros and cons of a layout, and allow strong decisions for before the code to take place. 
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
 - Low fidelity, mid fidelity, and high fidelity. Low is great for getting general and simple ideas across. Mid is great at starting to visualize some detail and workings of the product. High is great for showing a beta version that is going to be very similar to the end product. 
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
 -  It is something many people should strongly consider if they are taking on a large website project, or even app. Without it you can easily struggle with ideas within the code and even possibly struggle to visualize the different aspects of what you want to accomplish.
