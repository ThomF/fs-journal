## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
 - Pseudo represents something that targets a specific elements state. SO the hover attribute would be a pseudo and would be a very common one for interaction. 
2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
 - Specificity determines the best route for something being targeted by multiple rules at once. It could be used to quickly change something like a background color quickly by placing the rule at the top of the CSS file for a test. 
3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
 - I can see that when trying to use multiple classes that the !Important would override other things possibly and would make it difficult to change quickly.
