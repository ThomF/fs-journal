## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
 - I really like the idea of reducing opacity on text thats in front of a colored background to improve contrast on design and other more important text.
2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
 - I have a good tool to find great examples. Its called analogous research. This is where ou compare sites like addidas and costco to each other to find similarities and vast strengths and weaknesses. Stretching out of the boundary of what you are trying to do is very strong in terms of learning design.  
3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
 - Good design is the best marketing tool to sell or catch any user. If I go on a website and see that its bland and hard to navigate because of design they will lose me quick. Solid design that isnt super flashy is super important.
